### Documentation of the Code

#### Overview

`run.py` is a Python script designed to read data from multiple data streams, compute a moving average for each stream based on a specified window length, and write the results to designated output streams. This script supports named pipes (FIFOs) and standard input/output as data sources and destinations.

#### How It Works

- **Multi-Threading**: The script uses Python's threading to handle each data stream independently. This allows simultaneous processing of multiple data streams.
- **Process Stream**: Each data stream is processed by the `process_stream` function in a separate thread. This function opens the input stream (either a named pipe or stdin), reads data, calculates the moving average, and writes the result to the output stream.

#### Function: `process_stream`

- **Parameters**:
  - `win_len` (int): The window length for calculating the moving average.
  - `infilename` (str): The path to the input named pipe or `'-'` for stdin.
  - `outfilename` (str): The path to the output named pipe or `'-'` for stdout.
  - `retries` (int, optional): Number of retries to open a named pipe.
  - `delay` (int, optional): Delay in seconds between retries.
- **Behavior**: Attempts to open the input file (named pipe or stdin). If it's a named pipe, it retries a few times with a delay between retries. Reads 8-byte chunks from the input, calculates the moving average, and writes the result to the output.

#### Main Execution Block

- Loops through each argument provided to the script.
- Splits each argument to get the window length, input filename, and output filename.
- Creates and starts a new thread for each data stream using `process_stream`.

### Drawbacks and Possible Improvements

#### Drawbacks

1. **Limited Error Handling**: The current implementation has basic error handling. Robust handling of various edge cases, such as unexpected data formats or IO issues, is needed.
2. **Resource Intensive**: Using a thread for each data stream can be resource-intensive, especially with a large number of streams.
3. **No Dynamic Stream Handling**: The script doesn't handle dynamic addition or removal of data streams.

#### Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and logging for better fault tolerance and debugging.
2. **Resource Management**: Consider using a thread pool to limit the number of concurrent threads, reducing resource usage.



### Alternative Approaches

While the multi-threading approach is effective for independent processing of each stream, other methods can be considered:

1. **Message Queues**: Implement a producer-consumer model using message queues, where one process reads data and enqueues tasks, and worker processes or threads dequeue and process these tasks.
2. **Multiprocessing**: For CPU-bound operations or to bypass the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python, using multiprocessing can be more effective than threading.
